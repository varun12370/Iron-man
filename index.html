        <p>Iron Man is definitely the coolest superhero. His suit of armor is so facinating. I also like Iron Man because he proved that a human could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with demigods and super shoulders. With just his intellect, ingenuity and a couple million bucks, Iron Man is a self-made hero</p>
